Elevator
============
This was the final project for my Algorithms & Data Structures course at Florida Tech. The goal was to make an Elevator simulation in Java. Requirements included a baseline / "dummy" algorithm and an advanced algorithm that improves performance. We also had to prepare a GUI to present our data, and have some form of visual simulation.  

I was responsible for the following classes:
* AdvancedElevator.java
* BaselineElevator.java
* ElevatorGUI.java

Our two Elevator algorithms inherit from [Elevator](https://github.com/bcanseco/elevator/blob/master/Codebase/Elevator.java), [PassengerRequest](https://github.com/bcanseco/elevator/blob/master/Codebase/PassengerRequest.java), and [PassengerReleased](https://github.com/bcanseco/elevator/blob/master/Codebase/PassengerReleased.java), which were written by our GSA. I made the GUI using the Swing library and JFrame components. Elements were positioned using eclipse's WindowBuilder tool.

**To run, double-click the included Elevator.jar file.**  
An installation of Java is required. To install Java, go to https://www.java.com/en/download

The "old" folder contains deprecated classes not included in the final build.
