Elevator
============
This is an Elevator simulation written in Java for my Algorithms & Data Structures class at Florida Tech. Other team members were Luke Wiskowski and Liandra Bennett. I was responsible for AdvancedElevator.java, BaselineElevator.java, ElevatorGUI.java (generated by eclipse's WindowBuilder tool), and some of Visual.java.

**To run, double-click the included Elevator.jar file.**

The "old" folder contains deprecated classes not included in the final build.
